# Deep Learning Lab

My Deep Learing course assignments.

## Content

- **Lab1**: Implements core NumPy operations and basic image processing including grayscale conversion, Sobel edge detection, and patch shuffling using matrix manipulation.
- **Lab2**: Demonstrates polynomial regression with gradient descent optimization, comparing underfitting/overfitting scenarios and L2 regularization effects through synthetic sinusoidal data.
- **Lab3**: Builds linear models (LSM/Ridge Regression) and compares them with scikit-learn/numpy implementations, extending to polynomial feature space for nonlinear regression.
- **Lab4**: Implements fundamental classification algorithms - logistic regression (binary), softmax regression (multi-class), and perceptron - evaluated on breast cancer and iris datasets with accuracy metrics.
